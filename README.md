## Techs:
For the construction, a React + TypeScript template with vite was used. Also used:
- “taliwindcss” for styling;
- The “@headlessui/react” library to enable the accessible “Widget” component.
- The “phosphor-react” library for using icons;
- The “html2canvas” library for a screen capture functionality;
- Axios to consume a backend route.

## Get started:
- Open the terminal inside the project folder and do: 'npm install' or 'yarn add'. When all packages are installed, do 'npm dev' or 'yarn dev' to start in development mode.
